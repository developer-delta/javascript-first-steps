# Welcome to the repository for your first javascript code!

Steps to get set up:

* `cd` into a directory for all your programming work
* `git clone https://github.com/developer-delta/javascript-first-steps.git`
* `ls` to see the directory we just _cloned_ down.
* `cd javascript-first-steps`
* `mkdir your-name`
* `cd your-name`
* `touch app.js` This is your javascript file!
* `touch index.html`

---

> Please follow the structure of creating a new directory with your name, and then inside of that, add an `app.js` file and an `index.html` file. Feel free to copy this HTML code into `index.html` since we'll be focusing on JavaScript in this lesson.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My first JS</title>
    <!-- <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet"> -->
    <script src="link up to your js file"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Lastly just change the `src="` attribute to point to your `js` file. It's the same syntax as hooking up a CSS file!

### _Now [back to the lesson plan](https://github.com/developer-delta/curriculum/blob/main/lesson-5-js-intro.md) to write some javascript in our new file!_
